Here you will find a python3-pyqt5 script that I have worked on. 
If you followed my How-To, to include setting up yuor server as a `systemd --user service`, this should work just fine for a server running on a Debian/Ubuntu System with a desktop envirement.
You will need to install python3-pyqt5 and jq for this to work. Most systems will already have systemd intsalled by default.
